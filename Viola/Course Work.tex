\textbf{CAUSES OF INCREASED RATES OF ARBORTION IN TEENAGERS}\\
\end{center}

\section{INTRODUCTION}
\paragraph{•}
An abortion is a forceful termination of pregnancy .this happens with removal of the embryo or the fetus from a female body
Teenage abortions are surprisingly increasing mainly due to the growing exposure of teens to explore their sexuality without the right sex education. This eventually leads to physical relationships, pregnancies and subsequent abortions 
\paragraph{•}
The abortion methods used mainly are use of the abortion pill and surgical removal.
\paragraph{•}
The abortion pill is used for pregnancies up to nine weeks old. A combination of two drugs is taken. They are taken within 48 hours. The effect of the drugs is that the womb contracts and sheds its lining. The process is painful. This pain is experienced on the lower abdomen. It may cause diarrhea and vomiting.
\paragraph{•}
Surgical removal can be done when the fetus is at 13 to 14 weeks. A sterile tube is inserted through the cervix and into the uterus. Suction is done pulling out all the materials in the uterus. The woman may leave the hospital the same day after the procedure has been done. At 14 and 15 weeks, surgical dilation is done using forceps to remove the unwanted fetus.
  
\section{CAUSES}
\paragraph{•}
Abortion is caused by a myriad of factors among them social, religious and economic factors.
Young girls have a better chance at furthering their education once they get rid of the child. In African countries for instance, a young girl getting pregnant meant that she would have to be married off immediately. This would ruin her chances of ever getting formal education again. Getting rid of the baby provides an easier way out in the quest for education and a brighter future.
\paragraph{•}
Most times teenagers get pregnant when they are in a casual relationship and hence not ready to take the responsibility
\paragraph{•}
Fear in the mind that the baby will change their course of life
Social stigma associated with teenage pregnancies .Girls who decide to keep their babies become a subject of constant gossip and pity\\
Complications\\
The most common is bleeding. Bleeding occurs normally for a few weeks. It decreases as one nears weeks 5 and 6. In cases of excessive bleeding, there are chances that the uterus may not have been emptied completely.\\
Pelvic inflammatory disease. This disease affects the vaginal area she experiences severe abdominal pains. \\
Pain is a normal problem for the abortion process. It is often relieved by using painkillers or rechecking the uterus\\
The uterus may be punctured especially during surgical termination of pregnancy. The tools used may create a hole in the uterus causing complications.


\section{LITERATURE REVIEW}
\paragraph{•}
Abortion has a long history. In the past, it was done using crude tools such as sharpened tools, physical trauma and other traditional methods. With advancement in the field of medicine, contemporary methods are now used and involve the use of medication and surgical procedures (Nada 1998 page 61).
\paragraph{•}
According to the feminist women’s health center, a sexually active teenage girl who does not use regular contraception has 90 percent chance of conceiving and so become pregnant when their contraception like condoms, abortion pills fail

\section{CONCLUSION}
\paragraph{•}
It is true that pregnancy and motherhood require a lot of maturity where it becomes necessary for a mother to be responsible enough to parent and nurture the child as well as take care of herself and her needs .with teenage pregnancies the maturity and responsibility are not present hence abortion being an option due to the whole idea of teenage pregnancies being a child giving birth to a child 
Though physically this abortion procedure may not have a long term impact m, emotionally and mentally the girl may undergo severe stress that may leave her displaced for the rest of her life
\paragraph{•}
Abortion is a social, medical and a religious issue. It is entrenched into the legal laws of every country in the world in one way or another. It has a place in the lives of individuals directly or indirectly. Ethical values arise out of such deeds as abortion that determines the direction that one chooses. Other mechanisms that control abortion include the legal and religious aspects of society.
\paragraph{•}
Providing the necessary support in the form of financial aid and psychological support to mothers contemplating abortion could serve as the best way to curb such deaths resulting from abortion.
